# What is IT?

Information Technology powers global workhorses and websites that you use on a daily basis. Applications such as Amazon, Google, and GitHub power most of the world's online infrastructure, and all of that, made possible by Information Technology.

In this article, you will learn the following:

- **What Information Technology refers to**
- **Basic <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> facts**
- **Examples of Information Technology**
- **Applications of IT**
- **Importance of IT**

## Information Technology is Distribution

In simple terms, Information Technology refers to distributing information using computers and computer systems. Essentially, information technology deals with utilizing the power of computers to import, export, process, and store information like an interconnected hive. When you are reading this, IT is in full force as it is exchanging information between your browser and this webpage.

## Information Technology Examples

:::info
There many more examples than stated on the bulletpoint below. We are just stating the most important examples.

The "information" in Information Technology encompasses various types of data with a plethora of use cases. Some are specialized for simple exchanges of info, while others power large applications and networks.

Here are some bulletpoints:

- **The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> and Internet**

  - This type of IT includes tools for interacting with the Internet, heavily used in modern webpages and browsers. Examples include the browser you are using, HTML, CSS, HTTP, and other protocols and tools.

- **Internet of Things (IoT)**

  - IoT focuses on integrating physical devices with computer systems. It involves a network of interconnected devices equipped with sensors that exchange information, which is then stored on a hard drive somewhere. This type of IT is useful for physical automation, such as in kiosks and other physical devices all around you.

- **Cybersecurity**

  - Cybersecurity involves protecting computer systems from malicious attacks. These attacks can compromise systems in a way they act against their creator, similar to how a disease affects the body, but less contagious.

## Importance of Information Technology

Without IT, we would struggle to defend against hackers or maximize the utility of computers. Information Technology plays a crucial role in modern computer systems. For instance, IT enabled Google to become a search engine superpower and allows us to turn information into innovation by taking computers and equipping them with the power of exchanging useful information.

Information Technology is used to create websites, develop applications, conduct market research, and enhance customer development. More often than not, IT powers huge industries all over the world, just with some pieces of data.
