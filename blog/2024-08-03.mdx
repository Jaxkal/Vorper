## Starting Off

:::danger
This blog is still undergoing development. Please remain patient for the time being.
:::

Starting off, we used Docusaurus as a base for everything we needed, wonder why we picked Docusaurus instead of building our own from scratch, well there's something called "time" and we don't have much of it. Instead of wasting time building an entire site by ourselves, we just let Docusaurus do the heavy work.

## Integrating with GitHub

Once we had finished setting up our repository for the site and added some articles and blogs, we decided we wanted to make the deployment process 10x easier by automating deployment. How did we do this you may ask, well there's a thing called GitHub actions and it's pretty neat, it lets us setup a script on what to do when there is a commit. What we did was make it so that whenever there is a commit, it will automatically build the website's files and deploy to github pages, Woohoo! for ease of use.
